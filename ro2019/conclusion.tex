\section{Conclusion}\label{sec-conclusion}

By combining capabilities for querying transitive data dependencies with 
	approaches we propose in this paper for precisely characterizing the reproducibility
	of computed
	results and data products, we expect to bring the computational components of research
	studies represented by Research Objects 
	closer to the level of reproducibility that characterizes the natural sciences.
Such Research Objects would make clear what studies are reproducible and what methods
	underlying reproducible
	results can be used in future studies.
Research Objects that are transparent in this sense would allow researchers to build 
	on others' work with greater confidence---without 
	actually having to rerun another researcher's study.
This is reproducibility by other means.
