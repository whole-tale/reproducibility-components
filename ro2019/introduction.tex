\section{Introduction}

Publicly funded efforts around the world currently are underway to
	ensure that computational components of scientific research
	can be made ``reproducible'' or ``replicable''.
The ongoing discourse about the perceived ``reproducibility crisis in science''~\cite{donoho_reproducible_2009,baker_2016,fanelli_opinion:_2018}
	is just one illustration of the importance of these efforts.
The energy invested in the wide-ranging debate over the precise meanings of the
	terms \emph{reproducible}, \emph{replicable},
        \emph{transparent}, etc.\
        \cite{drummond2009replicability,carolegoble2016what,freire2016reproducibilitya,goodman2016what,ioannidis2017reproducibility,herouxtoward,plesser2018reproducibility,barba2018terminologies,committeeonreproducibilityandreplicabilityinscience2019reproducibility}, with
	respect to research results, processes, and settings is perhaps an even greater indication of
	both the significance of these efforts and the challenges they face.
So while each effort aimed at facilitating reproducible computing in the
	sciences must clearly define its mission and apply the bulk of its resources
	to the specific problems it sets out to address, these efforts necessarily do
	so within the context of broader discussions about the nature, importance,
	and precise definitions of the qualities of science we wish to extend to computing
	over the longer time scale.

Within a particular effort it is useful to define terms such as \emph{reproducible} operationally.
For example, in the Whole Tale project \cite{WT2019,brinckman2019computing} a \emph{Reproducible Tale} is one
	that \emph{includes sufficient information for the Tale to be re-executed for the review
	and verification of results}.
Adopting this definition focuses requirements analysis, system design,
	and software implementation efforts on the specific problems Whole Tale is funded to solve
	and the use cases it aims to support.
Supporting publishers who request authors to include all new data,
	code, and workflows needed to reproduce computed artifacts supporting
	claims in a paper is one such use case targeted by Whole Tale.
Facilitating re-execution of code used to generate
	key products of a study will enable publishers routinely to confirm that
	provided data and code do in fact produce those results---thereby addressing
	a key dimension of the reproducibility challenge currently facing science.

At the same time, it is critical that efforts like Whole Tale contribute to a global
	vision of computational reproducibility in the sciences, and clearly situate
	their particular missions, use cases, and engineering deliverables in this context.
For while the particular technical problems these projects
	aim to address are particularly pressing, current efforts by no means
	represent the entire landscape of concepts, problems, and technical options
	that will require further discussion, clarification, and analysis if we are to meet
	the challenges of reproducibility.
In particular, current engineering efforts are unlikely to elevate the computational components
	of research to the level of reproducibility historically expected of studies in the
	pure natural sciences such as physics, chemistry, and biology.

Consequently, the current generation of efforts to build reproducility platforms represents
    just a step towards the kind of platforms, infrastructure, and standards
	needed to enable researchers using computing technology to routinely
	achieve the reproducibility long considered the essence of science as a whole.
In support of this longer-term vision, we outline in this paper
 a few of the issues we aim to investigate and discuss with the broader community over the next few years.
We anticipate that future iterations of Whole Tale and its sibling efforts
	will be driven in part by the problem definitions and solution proposals we collectively
	develop between now and then.

In the remainder of this paper we briefly discuss five topics we plan to investigate
	as part of this research agenda.
In Section\,\ref{sec-reproducibility} we review the general notion of
reproducibility in science, and in Section\,\ref{sec-repeatability}
	highlight how digital computing in principle makes possible a completely new kind of reproducibility:
	\emph{exact repeatability}.
We emphasize that the notion of \emph{transparency}---long a critical element of
	reproducibility in the pure natural sciences---has a role to play even for those computational components
	of research where exact repeatability is feasible.
In Section\,\ref{sec-terminology} we provide an overview of several dimensions of the terminological debate around reproducibility
	generally, and propose that a pluralistic approach to defining key terms is essential if a general
	concept of reproducibility is to be shared across disciplines.
In Section\,\ref{sec-limitations} we summarize a number of limitations on exact repeatability in practice, and in Section\,\ref{sec-transparency}
	show how science-oriented provenance queries can mitigate such limitations by maintaining
 	the transparency most essential to reproducibility in science.
Throughout, we highlight the role that Research Objects \cite{bechhofer2013whya}
	can serve in supporting and maintaining reproducibility
	by encapsulating the information needed to rerun the computational steps in a study,
	by disambiguating claims about reproducibility,
	and by enabling transparency via queries of provenance information packaged in the object.
