  abstract = {Scientific workflow management systems offer features for composing complex computational pipelines from modular building blocks, executing the resulting automated workflows, and recording the provenance of data products resulting from workflow runs. Despite the advantages such features provide, many automated workflows continue to be implemented and executed outside of scientific workflow systems due to the convenience and familiarity of scripting languages (such as Perl, Python, R, and MATLAB), and to the high productivity many scientists experience when using these languages. YesWorkflow is a set of software tools that aim to provide such users of scripting languages with many of the benefits of scientific workflow systems. YesWorkflow requires neither the use of a workflow engine nor the overhead of adapting code to run effectively in such a system. Instead, YesWorkflow enables scientists to annotate existing scripts with special comments that reveal the computational modules and dataflows otherwise implicit in these scripts. YesWorkflow tools extract and analyze these comments, represent the scripts in terms of entities based on the typical scientific workflow model, and provide graphical renderings of this workflow-like view of the scripts. Future version of YesWorkflow will also allow the prospective provenance of the data products of these scripts to be queried in ways similar to those available to users of scientific workflow systems.},

It is easy to assume that computational methods self-document by their very nature of being exact, deterministic processes. However, similar to laboratory experiments, ensuring reproducibility in the computational realm requires the documentation of both the protocols used (workflows), as well as a detailed description of the computational environment: algorithms, implementations, software environments, and the data ingested and execution logs of the computation. These two aspects of computational reproducibility (workflows and execution details) are discussed within the context of biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (bioNMR), as well as the PRIMAD model for computational reproducibility.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

There seems to be a wide spread view that we need to do something to address this problem, as it is essential to the advancement of our field. The most compelling argument would seem to be that reproducibility of experimental results is the hallmark of science. Therefore, given that most of us regard machine learning as a scientific discipline, being able to replicate experiments is paramount.  I want to challenge this view by separating the notion of reproducibility, a generally desirable property, from replicability, its poor cousin. I claim there are important differences between the two.  Reproducibility requires changes; replicability avoids them. Although reproducibility is desirable, I contend that the impoverished version, replicability, is one not worth having.},

Funding agencies and journals, professional societies and even mass media are paying attention, often focusing on the so-called "crisis" of reproducibility. One big problem keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle the issue: different groups are using terminologies in utter contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad sample of publications in different fields, we can classify their terminology via decision tree: they either, A---make no distinction between the words reproduce and replicate, or B---use them distinctly. If B, then they are commonly divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts at a minimum standard of "same data+same methods=same results," to "new data and/or new methods in an independent study=same findings," group 1 calls the minimum standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate. This direct swap of the two terms aggravates an already weighty issue. By attempting to inventory the terminologies across disciplines, I hope that some patterns will emerge to help us resolve the contradictions.},

The project synopsis put together by Nosek and Errington (1) tried to describe carefully what replication means, how to judge whether ``same'' (or different) results emerge in a replication experiment, and how to interpret divergent results in original vs reproducibility studies. However, multiple other commentators on these first reproducibility studies have enhanced our uncertainty. Almost every commentator reached a somewhat different conclusion. Reproducibility of inferences has been dismal.

Several authors of the original papers along with other commentators have questioned the reproducibility effort. These retorts typically defend the original findings, interpreting the replications as more successful than unsuccessful. They question replications on multiple fronts, e.g., inappropriate statistical methods or poor experimental competence. They lament the inappropriate shaming consequences, when poorly done replication efforts tarnish great scientists. They worry that reproducibility checks destroy discovery and stall efforts to translate promising research. They wonder whether we should waste money on replication.

The reproducibility wars are not exclusive to laboratory science. Last year, a similar debate erupted with a Technical Comment exchange on the respective reproducibility project on psychology (2), although the available data were far more extensive (100 experiments instead of just 5 preliminary ones) and had a massive participation of top psychologists (270 scientists and their teams) trying to reproduce results. Some famous psychology academics nevertheless concluded that their field had no reproducibility problem and reproducibility was misleading business. This position is immediately suspect. If psychological science is so perfect, how can it be that 270 of the best psychologists in the world working under optimal conditions of openness and most rigorous protocols and methods could get everything so badly wrong?

  abstract = {Science is built upon foundations of theory and experiment validated and improved through open, trans- parent communication. With the increasingly central role of computation in scientific discovery this means communicating all details of the computations needed for others to replicate the experiment, i.e. making avail- able to others the associated data and code. The ``reproducible research'' movement recognizes that traditional scientific research and publication practices now fall short of this ideal, and encourages all those involved in the production of computational science \textendash{} scientists who use computational methods and the institutions that employ them, journals and dissemination mechanisms, and funding agencies \textendash{} to facilitate and practice really reproducible research.
This report summarizes discussions that took place during the ICERM Workshop on Reproducibility in Computational and Experimental Mathematics, held December 10-14, 2012. The main recommendations that emerged from the workshop discussions are:
1. It is important to promote a culture change that will integrate computational reproducibility into the research process.
2. Journals, funding agencies, and employers should support this culture change.
3. Reproducibleresearchpracticesandtheuseofappropriatetoolsshouldbetaughtasstandardoperat- ing procedure in relation to computational aspects of research.
The workshop discussions included presentations of a number of the diverse and rapidly growing set of soft- ware tools available to aid in this effort. We call for a broad implementation of these three recommendations across the computational sciences.},

  abstract = {One of the pathways by which the scientific community confirms the validity of a new scientific discovery is by repeating the research that produced it. When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery. about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research. and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of reproducibility between two computations, expectations about replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science.},

  abstract = {Scripts are widely used to design and run scientific experiments. Scripting languages are easy to learn and use, and they allow complex tasks to be specified and executed in fewer steps than with traditional programming languages. However, they also have important limitations for reproducibility and data management. As experiments are iteratively refined, it is challenging to reason about each experiment run (or trial), to keep track of the association between trials and experiment instances as well as the differences across trials, and to connect results to specific input data and parameters. Approaches have been proposed that address these limitations by collecting, managing, and analyzing the provenance of scripts. In this article, we survey the state of the art in provenance for scripts. We have identified the approaches by following an exhaustive protocol of forward and backward literature snowballing. Based on a detailed study, we propose a taxonomy and classify the approaches using this taxonomy.},

  shorttitle = {Replicability or Reproducibility?},
  abstract = {Replicability and reproducibility of computational models has been somewhat understudied by ``the replication movement.'' In this paper, we draw on methodological studies into the replicability of psychological experiments and on the mechanistic account of explanation to analyze the functions of model replications and model reproductions in computational neuroscience. We contend that model replicability, or independent researchers' ability to obtain the same output using original code and data, and model reproducibility, or independent researchers' ability to recreate a model without original code, serve different functions and fail for different reasons. This means that measures designed to improve model replicability may not enhance (and, in some cases, may actually damage) model reproducibility. We claim that although both are undesirable, low model reproducibility poses more of a threat to long-term scientific progress than low model replicability. In our opinion, low model reproducibility stems mostly from authors' omitting to provide crucial information in scientific papers and we stress that sharing all computer code and data is not a solution. Reports of computational studies should remain selective and include all and only relevant bits of code.},

This year, we have been in charge of reproducing the experiments provided by the authors (repeatability), and exploring changes to experiment parameters (workability). In this paper, we assess the SIGMOD repeatability process in terms of participation, review process and results. While the participation is stable in terms of number of submissions, we find this year a sharp contrast between the high participation from Asian authors and the low participation from American authors. We also find that most experiments are distributed as Linux packages accompanied by instructions on how to setup and run the experiments. We are still far from the vision of executable papers.},

	abstract = {This paper describes our recent and ongoing efforts to enhance the curation of scientific workflows to improve reproducibility and reusability of biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance (bioNMR) data. Our efforts have focused on both developing a workflow management system, called CONNJUR Workflow Builder (CWB), as well as refactoring our workflow data model to make use of the PREMIS model for digital preservation. This revised workflow management system will be available through the NMRbox cloud-computing platform for bioNMR. In addition, we are implementing a new file structure which bundles the original binary data files along with PREMIS XML records describing the provenance of the data. These are packaged together using a standardized file archive utility. In this manner, the provenance and data curation information is maintained together along with the scientific data. The benefits and limitations of these approaches, as well as future directions, are discussed in this paper.},
